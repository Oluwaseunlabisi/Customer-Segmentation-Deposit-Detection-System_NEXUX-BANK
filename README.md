# Customer-Segmentation-Deposit-Detection-System_NEXUX-BANK

## Problem Statement

Nexux is a bank that has conducted campaigns with the goal of acquiring deposits. The current situation at the bank is not encouraging in that customers don't really subscribe to term deposit and they also default. As a data scientist, the goal of this project is to determine how the customer demographics such as age, educational level e.t.c influences customers attitude toward defaulting and also predict the lkelihood of customers subscribing to term deposit by using Machine learning models in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank. The following steps will be taken to achieve the goal of this project:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Modelling - KMeans clustering will be used to do the Customer segmentation and 8 models will be evaluated for the classification task. Training and test data will be split into 70:30.
- Model Evaluation - Each of the 8 models will be compared and evaluated.

This will help the management of Nexux bank to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money on marketing to every customer in the bankâ€™s database, they can analyze which customer segment is most likely to subscribe to term deposit and then market the product only to that particular segment. In short, for marketing campaigns to be effective, the bank will know the right customers to target at the right time with the right messages or contents that will lead to large conversion.
